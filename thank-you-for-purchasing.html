        <p>If you wonder how do we get theme names here is the story. Our plan is to craft many, no, dozen Wordpress themes. Needed a system how to name them. In the beggining there were idea just use numbers. But.. Wordpress creators already doing this (default themes are named by the year) and it perhaps will arouse misunderstandings for our support team and clients.</p>

           What about minimalism? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimalist_artists">Minimalist artist names? </a>Wordpress release codenames are after well-know jazz musicians. We started to read about each artist. It took a while.. too long. We started to read more and do less. We had to change the direction. What about the shapes? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors_(compact)">Colors? </a>We did some search in Wordpress theme repository to check how many themes do have color names. Found some, but not many. Plenty names to choose from. Finally!!!</p>
